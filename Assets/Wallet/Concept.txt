Wallet Sniffer

POCO
Player Owned Customs Office

Concept
- with Eve SSO access
- we can read corporation wallet details
- which allows us to monitor POCO taxes (planetary industry)
- and establish patterns of usage

Intelligence
- identify recurring characters and corps
- find time zones and planets
- lay in wait and crush
- preferrably without providing return intel

Problem
Eve SSO access requires storage of a secret (application API key)
GitHub free hosting doesn't have a way to save secrets securely
